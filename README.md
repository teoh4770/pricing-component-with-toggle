## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS, BEM methodology
- JavaScript DOM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's been a while since I do the last Frontend Mentor challenge (about 2 months ago...). I have a lot of fun, and learn a tiny bit from this project. This is what I have learnt:
1. BEM methodology: follow BEM while building CSS make the CSS cleaner, thus easier to understand and build upon.
2. CSS class toggle: Realize that I can make logic with CSS classes by toggling the certain class with JavaScript
3. Making toggle button: Using the fact that label connects with the input of checkbox, I learnt how to create a toggle button with just the label alone.

### Useful resources

- [Pricing Table Toggle - Design to HTML/CSS from Florin Pop]([https://www.example.com](https://www.youtube.com/live/NBkD-O7f4Bs?feature=share)) - By watching this video, it's not only help me understand how to build this thing, check the mistakes I made, but learn the way he codes, and the reason he codes that way.
